SLF4M is a simple but flexible logging framework for Matlab, built on top of SLF4J and Apache Log4j. You can use it to do runtime-configurable logging from your Matlab scripts and programs. This can be more informative and more manageable than commenting `fprintf()` statements in and out.


SLF4M provides:


* Logging functions
* A `dispstr` API for customizing object display.
* A Log4j configuration GUI


The API is simple enough that you can get up and running with it quickly, or even use it casually in scripts, but it's flexible and powerful enough to be useful for larger systems.


Usage
-------------------------


The logging functions are in the `+logm` package. Call them from within your Matlab code.


function helloWorld(x)

if nargin < 1 || isempty(x)
    x = 123.456;
    % These debug() calls will only show up if you set log level to DEBUG
    logm.debug('Got empty x input; defaulted to %f', x);
end
z = x + 42;

logm.info('Answer z=%f', z);
if z > intmax('int32')
    logm.warn('Large value z=%f will overflow int32', z);
end

try
    some_bad_operation(x);
catch err
    logm.error(err, 'Something went wrong in some_bad_operation(x=%f)');
end

end


The output looks like this:


>> helloWorld
17:27:32.533 INFO  helloWorld()  - Answer z=165.456000
17:27:32.557 ERROR helloWorld()  - Something went wrong in some_bad_operation(
Undefined function 'some_bad_operation' for input arguments of type 'double'.
Error in helloWorld (line 16)
    some_bad_operation(x);

Thanks to `dispstr()`, you can also pass Matlab objects to the `%s` conversions.

>> m = containers.Map;
>> m('foo') = 42; m('bar') = struct;
>> logm.info('Hello, world! %s', m)
09:52:29.809 INFO  base - Hello, world! 2-by-1 containers.Map
